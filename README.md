# Adversarial-Attacks-on-Road-Signs

This is the code repository for the final year project at the American University of Beirut. 
<br /> The paper: Adersarial Attacks on Road Signs can be downloaded above. 

## 1. Introduction

The recognition of traffic signs has received increasing attention in recent years. 
Self-driving cars need traffic sign recognition in order to properly parse and 
understand the roadway. Similarly, “driver alert” systems inside cars need to
understand the roadway around them to help aid and protect drivers. Traffic sign 
classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road, 
including speed limit signs, yield signs, merge signs, etc. Being able to automatically
recognize traffic signs enables us to build “smarter cars”. Traffic sign recognition is
just one of the problems that computer vision and deep learning can solve. We first detect
that this object is a traffic sign then classify it. In this project we study traffic sign 
object detection and classification. We then survey adversarial attacks against traffic sign
detection and classification.
